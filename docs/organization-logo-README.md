## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Backend (Elixir/Phoenix)

**Database Changes:**
```elixir
# Migration: 20251014000001_add_logo_to_organizations.exs
- Added logo_media_id UUID field to organizations table
- Foreign key to medias table with ON DELETE SET NULL
- Created index for performance
```

**Schema Updates:**
```elixir
# organizations/organization.ex
- Added belongs_to(:logo_media, Castmill.Resources.Media, ...)
- Updated changeset to accept logo_media_id
```

**Business Logic:**
```elixir
# resources.ex
- Modified delete_media/1 to check for logo usage
- Returns {:error, :media_in_use_as_logo} when protected
- Controller returns HTTP 409 Conflict with error message
```

### Frontend (TypeScript/SolidJS)

**Data Layer:**
```typescript
// interfaces/organization.ts
interface Organization {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  logo_media_id?: string;  // New field
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

**UI Components:**

1. **LogoSettings Component** (`logo-settings.tsx`)
   - Modal-based media selector
   - Image-only media filtering
   - Live logo preview
   - Select/Remove functionality
   - Permission-aware UI

2. **Organization Page** (`organization-page.tsx`)
   - Integrated LogoSettings component
   - State management for logo
   - Reactive updates

3. **Topbar** (`topbar.tsx`)
   - Displays organization logo
   - Visual separator from Castmill logo
   - Auto-updates on org switch
   - Responsive sizing (max 3em height, 10em width)
