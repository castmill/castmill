# Castmill Getting Started Guide

This document explains all the steps needed to get an instance of Castmill running on your premises.

Castmill is composed on several modules and components, using diverse technologies such as Typescript,
Elixir, NodeJS, etc. In order to facilitate running Castmill, we provide dockerfiles that build and
prepare the system so that it can easily be run on a machine that is running Docker. Therefore
you need to have Docker installed before you can run Castmill with this method.
