# Player

## Description

The player is a NPM package written in Typescript that implements all the necessary logic to present any type of media on a display.
The player itself is a library that can be used standalone or more commonly as a dependency of a given "device" implementation (see "Devices" to understand what a device is).

The player also includes all the SolidJS components that are used for implementing Castmill Widgets. The Widgets are flexible enough to just be specified as JSON and do not require any additional code to be written.

## Installation

If you want to use the player package component in your project, you can install it using NPM or YARN:

```bash
npm install --save @castmill/player
```

```bash
yarn add @castmill/player
```

## Usage

The library is composed of several classes, please see every class page for more information on how to use them.
