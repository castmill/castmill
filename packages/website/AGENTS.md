## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Build Process
1. **Always run full build** before deployment to regenerate social cards
2. **Social card generation** happens during `docusaurus build` via custom plugin
3. **Images are generated separately** using the Node.js script with Puppeteer

### Dependencies
- **React/React-DOM**: Added explicitly to resolve peer dependency warnings
- **@mdx-js/react**: Required for MDX content processing
- **@types/react**: TypeScript support for React components

### Common Issues
- **SSR compatibility**: Components must work with server-side rendering
- **Theme consistency**: Always test both light and dark modes
- **Social card previews**: Check `build/img/social/` for HTML templates before image generation

## 🎨 Styling Guidelines

When working on the website:
- **Follow existing CSS patterns** in `src/css/custom.css`
- **Test both themes** - light and dark mode compatibility
- **Use CSS custom properties** for theme-aware styling
- **Maintain professional appearance** suitable for enterprise customers

## 🧪 Testing

- **Build testing**: Always test `yarn build` after changes
- **Preview testing**: Use `yarn serve` to test production build locally
- **Social card testing**: Verify generated images in browser dev tools

Remember: This is a professional documentation site representing Castmill to enterprise customers. Maintain high quality standards and test thoroughly before deployment.
