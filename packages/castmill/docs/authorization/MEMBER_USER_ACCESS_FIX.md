# Fix: Member Users Can Now Access Playlists and Resources# Fix: Regular Users Can Now Access Playlists and Resources



## Problem## Problem



Member users (formerly the "regular" role) in an organization were **unable to list playlists** (and other resources) even though the new permission matrix granted them full access.Regular users with the "regular" role in an organization were **unable to list playlists** (and other resources) even though the new permission matrix granted them full access.



## Root Cause## Root Cause



The issue was in the **integration between the old and new authorization systems**:The issue was in the **integration between the old and new authorization systems**:



1. **New System Created**: We built a centralized permission matrix in `lib/castmill/authorization/permissions.ex`1. **New System Created**: We built a centralized permission matrix in `lib/castmill/authorization/permissions.ex`

2. **Old System Still Active**: The `resource_controller.ex` was using `Organizations.has_access/4`2. **Old System Still Active**: The `resource_controller.ex` was using `Organizations.has_access/4`

3. **Database Dependency**: `Organizations.has_access/4` was checking the `OrganizationsUsersAccess` database table3. **Database Dependency**: `Organizations.has_access/4` was checking the `OrganizationsUsersAccess` database table

4. **Missing Entries**: Member users had no entries in that table → Access denied ❌4. **Missing Entries**: Regular users had no entries in that table → Access denied ❌

## Solution## Solution



We updated `Organizations.has_access/4` to **use the permission matrix as the primary authorization source**, with database checks as a fallback.Updated `Organizations.has_access/4` to **use the permission matrix as the primary authorization source**, with database checks as a fallback.
