# Castmill

This is the server component of the Castmill platform. It provides the following features:
* An API for managing networks, organizations, users, devices, playlists and content.
* An admin web interface for managing all the above.
- A player server that allows devices to register, connect and play content.

## Usage

The server is implemented in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) using the [Phoenix framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/). To start your Castmill server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser to access the Device server, or
[`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000/admin) to access the admin interface.

## Deployment

This server can be deployed on any host that supports docker.


### Fly.io

Fly.io is a cloud provider with pretty good support for elixir applications.
In order to deploy Castmill you will first need to signup in fly.io. At the time of writing
even though you can use it for free for development purposes it will require a credit card
in order to get the necessary free allowances.
